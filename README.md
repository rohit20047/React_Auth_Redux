# Project README

## Overview

This project is a web application that implements authentication (sign-in/login) for private routing, utilizing Redux for state management, React Hook Form for form implementation, and Appwrite as the backend service. It's inspired by the repository [React-Auth-Private-Routes-With-Appwrite](https://github.com/divanov11/React-Auth-Private-Routes-With-Appwrite).

## Features

1. **Authentication**: Users can sign in and log in securely to access the private routes of the application.
2. **Private Routing**: Private routes are implemented to restrict access to certain parts of the application to authenticated users only.
3. **Redux State Management**: Redux is used for managing the application's state, providing a centralized store for data management.
4. **Form Implementation**: The project utilizes React Hook Form for efficient and flexible form implementation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **React Hook Form**: A library for managing form state and validation in React applications.
- **Appwrite**: An open-source platform for building end-to-end backend applications.
